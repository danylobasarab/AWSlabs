# Lab 5 (STORED PROGRAMS IN MYSQL)

Based on the previous work **(back-end with Spring Boot)**, a number of software structures `(triggers, procedures, functions, cursors)` should be written for the existing database. For stored procedures, ensure that they are called using **backend controllers**.

### Tasks List

1. Add an additional arbitrary table to DB and connect it to another existing table with a `1:M relationship`. However, to ensure value integrity, use triggers instead of a `physical foreign key`.

2. Stored procedures:
    
    * Provide parameterized insertion of new values into an arbitrary table.
    * To ensure the implementation of `M:M connection between 2 tables`, i.e. to insert into the connecting table the corresponding tape according to the real-existing values **(surname, name)** in these main tables.
    * Create a package that inserts 10 tapes into an arbitrary DB table in the format `<Noname+No>`, for example: **Noname5, Noname6, Noname7, etc.**
    * Write a custom function that will search for `Max, Min, Sum or Avg` for a column of an arbitrary table in the database. Write a procedure that will call this function in **SELECT**.
    * Write 1 procedure with a cursor to perform one of the following tasks:
    ```
    A) Using a cursor, ensure the dynamic creation of 2 tables with names containing a time stamp, the structure of the tables is identical to any structure of a DB table. Then randomly copy tapes from the parent table to one or the other additional table. Re-starting the procedure again creates new similar tables, in which the data from the parent table will be randomly spread again.
    B) Using a cursor, ensure dynamic creation of tables with names+timestamp taken from a column from an arbitrary DB table, with a random number of columns (from 1 to 9). Column names and type are arbitrary.
    C) Using a cursor, ensure dynamic creation of databases with names taken from a column from an arbitrary table of the current database, with a random number of tables for each database (from 1 to 9). The structure of the tables is arbitrary. The names of the tables correspond to the name of the database with a serial number from 1 to 9.
    ```
3. Write `3 arbitrary triggers` for the tables of the current database, as an example you can take the following:
   * The value of a certain column cannot end with two zeros
   * Prohibit any modification of the data in the table
   * Prohibit removal of tapes from the table
   * Ensure a minimum cardinality of 6 tapes for a certain DB table
   * Ensure the cardinality **(min=2, max=6)** of tapes for a certain database table
   * Create a log table in which to keep logs with a time stamp when data is `deleted for a certain table`
   * Create a log table in which to keep logs with a time stamp when data is `modified for the table`
   * For a specific column, provide the input format:
   > 2 arbitrary letters, except M and R + '-' + 3 numbers + '-' + 2 numbers
   * For a specific column, provide the input format:
   > 1 letter: A, M or Z + 5 numbers + 2 random letters
   * Only the following names are allowed for a given column: 'Svitlana', 'Petro', 'Olha', 'Taras'.
   * For a specific column, provide the input format:
   > the first letter in the value must match the first letter of the value of the adjacent field in the string
